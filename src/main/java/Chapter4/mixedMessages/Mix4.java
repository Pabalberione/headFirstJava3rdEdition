/**
 * A short Java program is listed to your right. Two blocks of the program are missing.
 * Your challenge is to match the candidate blocks of code (below) with the output
 * that youâ€™d see if the blocks were inserted. Not all the lines of output will be used, and
 * some of the lines of output might be used more than once. Draw lines connecting
 * the candidate blocks of code with their matching command-line output.
 *
 * Candidates
 * i < 9
 * index < 5
 *
 * i < 20
 * index < 5
 *
 * i < 7
 * index < 7
 *
 * i < 19
 * index < 1
 *
 * Possible outputs
 * 14 7
 * 9 5
 * 19 1
 * 14 1
 * 25 1
 * 7 7
 * 20 1
 * 20 5
