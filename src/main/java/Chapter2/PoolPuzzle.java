 * Your job is to take code snippets from the
 * pool and place them into the blank
 * lines in the code. You may not use the
 * same snippet more than once, and
 * you won’t need to use all the snippets. Your goal is to make a class that
 * will compile and run and produce the
 * output listed. Don’t be fooled—this one’s
 * harder than it looks.
