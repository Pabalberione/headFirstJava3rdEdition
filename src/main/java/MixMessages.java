/**
 * A short Java program is listed below. One block of the program
 * is missing. Your challenge is to match the candidate block of
 * code (on the left) with the output that youâ€™d see if the block
 * were inserted. Not all the lines of output will be used, and some
 * of the lines of output might be used more than once. Draw lines
 * connecting the candidate blocks of code with their matching
 * command-line output.
